Over 500 Original Usernames Available
The biggest repository of original usernames you'll ever find.
Below you will be able to search for alphabetically for a username that fits you. Because of the ridiculous amount of usernames available, the prices of these usernames will be vastly lower than original market prices. This will put an end to the elitists selling accounts for $300 or more.</p>
All accounts are secured as chats to make transactions smooth and create an easy transition of ownership. Because of the high volume of requests for usernames you should expect a wait-time of at least 5 minutes. All transactions are safely secured with Paypal and once you pay for a username, you will be told when the username is free to register. Furthermore, all transactions are final.

Security is Our Priority
Developers: Debugger / Aeri<br>  
Bot: Iceball
As recently stated, every account is secured as a chat, and when a purchase is made, the account will be freed to register. Warning: Do NOT disclose the username to ANYONE before purchasing it. Failure to listen to this warning may lead to someone you know registering your account. If you have any questions or concerns you can message the developers listed, or the helper bot (coming soon).
